This PowerShell/PowerTool script will log into UCSM and generate an Excel spreadsheet of all your Service Profiles that have vHBAs associated with them.  The spreadsheet will contain your Service Profiles, WWPNs for the A and B fabric and the WWNN.
 
The script will work with Service Profiles that have two vHBAs (Fabric A and B) or a single vHBA on either the A or B fabric.  It will not support systems where you have a mix of the above.
 
I created this script for my customers so they could provide their SAN administrator a list of WWPNs for doing zoning and initiator groups during the creation of LUNs.
 
The script requires that the client machine be running PowerShell, PowerTool and Excel.  The client must also have a UCSM login and be on a network that has access to UCSM.
 
Change Log:
     v0.3 - Initial Posted Version
     v0.4 - New look and feel and common script design
     v0.4.01 - Added built in help.  Command line options.  Standard naming convention.
     v0.4.02 - Added support for saved credentials file
 
As always, please let me know if you have questions, problems or suggestions for the script.

.SYNOPSIS
	This script allows you to log into a UCSM domain and it will collect all of the WWPNs and WWNNs for each created Service Profile in the UCS Domain and write that information to an Excel document.

.DESCRIPTION
	This script allows you to log into a UCSM domain and it will collect all of the WWPNs and WWNNs for each created Service Profile in the UCS Domain and write that information to an Excel document.

.EXAMPLE
	Get-UcsWwpn.ps1
	This script can be run without any command line parameters.  User will be prompted for all parameters and options required

.EXAMPLE
	Get-UcsWwpn.ps1 -ucs "1.2.3.4" -ucred
	-ucs -- UCS Manager IP or Host Name -- Example: "1.2.3.4" or "myucs" or "myucs.domain.local" or "1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8" or "myucs1,myucs2" or "myucs1.domain.local,myucs2.domain.local"
	-ucred -- UCS Manager Credential Switch -- Adding this switch will immediately prompt you for your UCSM username and password
	All parameters are optional and any skipped will be prompted for during execution
	The only prompts that will always be presented to the user will be for User Names and Passwords
	
.EXAMPLE
	Get-UcsWwpn.ps1 -ucs "1.2.3.4" -saved "myucscred.csv" -skiperrors
	-ucs -- UCS Manager IP or Host Name -- Example: "1.2.3.4" or "myucs" or "myucs.domain.local" or "1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8" or "myucs1,myucs2" or "myucs1.domain.local,myucs2.domain.local"
	-savedcred -- UCSM credentials file -- Example: -savedcred "myucscred.csv"
		To create a credentials file: $credential = Get-Credential ; $credential | select username,@{Name="EncryptedPassword";Expression={ConvertFrom-SecureString $_.password}} |Export-CSV -NoTypeInformation .\myucscred.csv
		Make sure the password file is located in the same folder as the script
	-skiperrors -- Tells the script to skip any prompts for errors and continues with 'y'
	All parameters are optional and any skipped will be prompted for during execution
	The only prompts that will always be presented to the user will be for User Names and Passwords
